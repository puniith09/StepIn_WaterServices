## Introduction
  
  The concept of the Simple Water Ordering System is based on ordering and serving water. This project does not have a login mechanism. A user can use this page to order Water products, serve them, and check totals. This project just has a few features, but these are the most important ones.


### The advantages of a water ordering system

When it comes to the Simple Water Ordering System, the user may quickly order any of the available waters. The user must input his or her name, the total number of the item, the item code number, and the amount to do so. Water objects do not have a CRUD function. Each item has its own size, and the user must pick the appropriate size before placing an order. The entire cost is displayed once an item is ordered. The chosen Water products must also be served. After an order is placed, the user may effortlessly serve Water. The user may also view the cafe's overall records, which show the total number of orders taken and served.
